        p
            | When natural disasters like typhoons, tornadoes, or earthquakes hit, buildings collapse and people displace.
            | During the process of reconstruction, a temporary shelter may need to be built for the victims.

                | Fold the Refuge is formed by foldable components, which is designed for efficient delivery and quick construction. 
            | Therefore, when disasters happen, victims can move into Fold the Refuge,
            | living with their loved families within a relatively short time.

            | All the components of Fold the Refuge are designed to fit in a standard 20' container.
            | Therefore, these components can be loaded to a container and shipped to the destination with a cargo truck.
        p.bmb
            | After arriving at the destination, the three components which form the floor and the side walls are first concatenated.
            | Later, the two components for the fa√ßade and the back are placed on the concatenated base.
            | In the end, the rest of the wall can be folded and form the side walls and the ceiling.

            | The part forms the floor and side wall are extendable. Here, a 2-block structure for 4 people is demostrated.
            | However, according to the amount of people, free space of the site, or other special needs,
            | Fold the Refuge can be shrink to 1 block or expend to 3 or more.
