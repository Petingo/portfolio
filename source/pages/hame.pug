        h2 Introduction
        p.bmb
            | We designed an FPS game using Unity 3D and integrated it with an Arduino device to study the
            | effectiveness of physical feedback in increasing the immersion of FPS game.
        
        h3 1. Game
        p.bmb
            | In the game, the player need to find the exit of a maze and dodge the monsters (the green cube) on the way.
            | The character is equipped with a gun to kill the monsters. However, the bullets is limited.
            | Also, when the character hit by the monster or bumped into the wall, its Health Points (HP) will decrease.
            | When HP runs out, the character will die.

        h3 2. Device
        p.bmb
            | We tied four servo motors on the playerâ€™s hands, chest, and back. They would be triggered when the character is attacked by a monster or bump into a wall.
